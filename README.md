## About the Project

This project inlcudes a web application through which sunny places can be found. The sunny locations are displayed via an image of a cam. In the background of the application a ML algorithm is used to decide which cameras are selected. The alogrithm is trained with scraped webcam images and is used to check the current webcam images and analyse wheter it is a sunny image or a not sunny image. You can see an example of classified images below.

Here you can get a glimps of the real web interface. Everywhere there is an icon on the map, there is a webcam. If the picture shows good weather, a sun icon is displayed, if the picture shows bad weather, a cloud icon is displayed.

## System architecture

### Client Web Application - Overview
The following graphic shows the parts of sun spotter application.

### Client Web Application - Scaling

If there is a lot of load, the Apache server can perform load balancing for several Sunspotter WebApp instances.
Even though webcams are currently only scraped and predicted for Switzerland, it is planned that one Helios and one Voyager instance per country will be responsible for scraping and predicting. See following graphic.

## Machine Learning - Jupyter Notebooks
To solve the classification problem of sunny and not sunny webcam images, transfer learning is used. In particulary Keras and Tensorflow with its pre-trained models from TensorHub were used to develop the image classifier model for Sunspotter.

* _Productive Code_ Transer-Learning with pretrained CNN-Model see file: [transferLearningCNNClassificationSunSpotter.ipynb](https://github.com/ZHAW-WI-AFEII-Project-HS2021/afeII-hs2021-project-sunspotter/blob/main/code/jupyterNotebook/transferLearningCNNClassificationSunSpotter.ipynb)
  * CNN model used from Tensorflow Hub" mobilenet_v3_small_075_224": "https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v3_small_075_224/feature_vector/5",
  * Fully connected layer with two classes prediction "notSunny" and "sunny"
* _Used Just for experimentation_ The own CNN-Model with classifier see file: [ownCNNClassificationSunSpotter.ipynb](https://github.com/ZHAW-WI-AFEII-Project-HS2021/afeII-hs2021-project-sunspotter/blob/main/code/jupyterNotebook/ownCNNClassificationSunSpotter.ipynb)

The Performance of the model was measured with a confusion matrix, prediction was made with the test dataset. Most important metric for sunspotter is the _precision for class sunny_! This is because we want to show the user, where he or she should go the get some sun.

## Getting Started Todo @chrismat

#### Start Sun spotter webapp and TensorBoard
üöß under construction...
Start the sunspotter app and TensorBoard containers

```./docker-compose up```

or if you want to fore a rebuild of the containers:

```./docker-compose up --build```

#### Open the sun spotter app in your web browser

üöß under construction...
```http://sunspotter.ch:443```

##### Functionalities

1. Scrape webcams: Scrape random webcams from windy.com and initializes the database
2. Geocode all webcams: Try to geocode the webcam positions with the webcam name (if the checkbox 'Use geocode services' is checked its done with the geocode service from the openrouteservice.org. Otherwise the positions are read from earlier file cached responses from this service.)
3. Predict all webcams: Runs a weather prediction with Tensorflow for all webcams with their live image from the actual hour (takes some time ~5min)
